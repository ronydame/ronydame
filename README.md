- 👋 Hi, I’m Rony Dame Saragih
- 👀 I’m interested in C language
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C language and the other language programs (like python, java, etc.)
- 💞️ Actually, I’m especially looking to collaborate with Indonesian because of my limitation language in English, but it will not limit me personally to collaborate to everyone.
- 📫 You can reach me by contacting 24ronydame@gmail.com
